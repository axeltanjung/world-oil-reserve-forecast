# Oil Reserves & Consumption Dataset (1995–2022)

## Overview
This dataset provides comprehensive insights into **global oil reserves and oil consumption trends** from **1995 to 2022**. It covers multiple countries and regions, enabling longitudinal analysis of fossil fuel availability, energy demand, and geopolitical or policy-driven changes in the global energy landscape.

The dataset is structured to support **time-series analysis**, **cross-country comparisons**, and **energy policy research**.

---

## Dataset Structure

Each record represents a **country or region (`Entity`)** observed in a given **year**, with corresponding values for oil reserves and oil consumption.

### Columns

| Column Name | Description |
|------------|------------|
| `Entity` | Country or region name |
| `Year` | Observation year (1995–2022) |
| `Oil Reserves` | Proven oil reserves, typically measured in barrels or metric tons |
| `Oil Consumption (TWh)` | Annual oil consumption measured in terawatt-hours (TWh) or equivalent |

## Key Concepts

### Oil Reserves
Proven oil reserves refer to quantities of oil that are **economically recoverable** under current market conditions and technological capabilities. These figures are subject to revision due to:
- Technological advancements
- Changes in oil prices
- Reassessment of geological data

### Oil Consumption
Oil consumption captures the **final energy use** of oil across sectors such as:
- Transportation
- Industrial production
- Power generation
- Residential and commercial usage

Consumption values are reported in **energy-equivalent units (TWh)** to allow comparison with other energy sources.

---

## Time Coverage
- **Start Year:** 1995  
- **End Year:** 2022  
- **Frequency:** Annual

---

## Potential Use Cases

### 1. Trend Analysis
- Long-term evolution of global and regional oil consumption
- Depletion or growth of proven oil reserves
- Identification of structural breaks (e.g., policy shifts, economic crises)

### 2. Regional Comparison
- Reserve-to-consumption ratios across countries
- Energy dependency and export/import dynamics
- Comparative fossil fuel reliance

### 3. Forecasting & Scenario Analysis
- Energy demand forecasting
- Resource depletion modeling
- Climate transition and decarbonization scenarios

### 4. Policy & Strategy
- Energy security assessments
- Sustainability and climate policy evaluation
- Investment and infrastructure planning

## Data Sources & Reliability
The dataset aggregates information from **authoritative and widely cited sources**, including:
- National energy departments
- International energy organizations
- Industry and statistical reports

Standardized methodologies and periodic updates are used to ensure **cross-country comparability** and **temporal consistency**.

---

## Data Quality Notes
- Some countries or years may contain missing values due to reporting limitations.
- Reserve estimates may change retrospectively as new information becomes available.
- Consumption values are normalized to energy units to support multi-energy analysis.

Users are encouraged to perform **missing data checks** and **outlier diagnostics** before advanced modeling.

---

## Recommended Applications
- Academic research in energy economics and environmental studies
- Industry analysis for energy companies and investors
- Government and policy research on energy security and climate mitigation
